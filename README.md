# Lissajous_Curve_Table

Lissajous curves are the family of curves described by the parametric equations

- x(t)	=	Acos(omega_xt-delta_x)	
- y(t)	=	Bcos(omega_yt-delta_y),

sometimes also written in the form

- x(t)	=	asin(omegat+delta)	
- y(t)	=	bsint.	

made from a graphics library in javascript p5.js.
